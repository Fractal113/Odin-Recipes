    <h2> About the dish:</h2>
    <p><i>

        This is another one of my favorite dishes! Lots of portions for left overs and plenty for a small or big dinner!
        Also great for holidays or just a casual dinner this is my go to recipe for chicken alfredo.
        I'ts always nice to make alfredo sauce from scratch! Fresh herbs and the parmasean and combination of garlic!
        Is what makes this dish so good you'll be grabbing seconds!

            Cooking the dish is fairly easy! The only time consuming part of this dish is cooking the chicken!
            The sauce doesnt take very long to simmer! depending on your herbs if theyre fresh cut them up as prep before you start cooking!
            The red pepper could be optional but I think it goes with the dish well! chop them thinley in long slices.
            Add chicken stock to thin and more heavy cream and parmasean to thicken as needed!
            Garlic,fresh herbs ,heavy cream and chicken broth is vital for a delicous alfredo sauce!
