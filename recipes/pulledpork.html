    <h2> About the dish:</h2>
    <p><i>
        A great very easy crock pot dish that is also delicous everytime! Love making this recipe in the winter and summer!Great for any time of the year.
        Wondeful for sandwiches at the cook out or tacos for dinner!Very flavorful but still sweet while also scratching that bbq craving.
        My favorite thing about this dish is the servings! you can feed alot of people with this recipe! You'll know its time if the prok shreds very easily with a fork!
